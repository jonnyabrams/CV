## Jonny Abrams

Coding is a passion I'd never envisaged for myself, but with hindsight it makes total sense. It combines key elements of my other main passions in life: the lateral thinking and endless solutions of creative writing, the intuitive decision-making of musical composition, even a touch of comedy with the testing frameworks heckling away from the gallery (Jest couldn't be more aptly named in this regard).

(Sometimes it requires the stamina of long-distance running, although Pomodoro helps make this a little more like interval training...)

The deeper I dive into it, the more fascinating and rewarding it seems to get, so it seems like a no-brainer to make a career out of it. Having encountered a string of testimonials from professional coders as to how much they enjoy their work, I thought I'd see what all the fuss was about. I knew some basic HTML from my journalism days, so I buried my head in freecodecamp's online courses before eventually enrolling at the Makers Academy boot camp in London. 

How sweetly naive it seems to me now, the notion that knowing some basic HTML would stand me in good stead for what was to come. Nevertheless I'd like to think I rose to the challenge, primarily because I really, really enjoy it. Ever since I found myself shunning televised football matches to do Codewars katas during the run-up to Makers, I knew this is what I wanted to be doing with my life.
 
In my time as a journalist and online editor, I got to do many things I could previously only have dreamed of: I'd conducted face-to-face interviews with household names from the worlds of sport and entertainment, including many personal heroes, and I'd poured my accumulated expertise and contacts into setting up a small media company. These experiences unlocked a lot of initiative and self-discipline that I didn't know I had; I had to constantly dream up new features, fine-tune existing ones and mentor new writers, just as I myself had been mentored when starting out on the Entertainment desk at Edinburgh Evening News. It also required a level of research that continues to serve me well when new challenges present themselves.

My time at Makers taught me so much, not least that I absolutely love working as part of a team. The best weeks of the course for me were those spent doing group projects, and I found Makers' emphasis on pair-programming to be ideal. I'm a sociable person and the daily interaction reawakened something in me that had been suppressed by years of working relatively individually. Even when the collaborative working was remote, it was a joy to bounce ideas off other people and learn from them.

## Skills

#### Attention to Detail

From very early on in my career I was entrusted with proofreading and subediting duties due to my sharp eye for factual and grammatical accuracy. Needless to say these instincts have been a huge help when it comes to debugging! In my time I've interviewed hundreds of public figures and was always allowed to take the lead on every step of the process: sourcing the interview, researching it, conducting it, transcribing it and eventually publishing it (usually via a WordPress system). I believe this is testament to my thoroughness.

#### Creativity

It's always been incumbent on me to drive the creation and implementation of new features for the publications I've worked at. In fact, it was my supply of ideas that earned me a position at Sport.co.uk following me initial period of work experience. In my spare time my hobbies are making music and comedy. A bit of lateral thinking shouldn't go amiss in the world of software development, and it's always been a strength of mine.

#### Personability

I tend to get on well with pretty much anyone, which is why I was always entrusted with establishing and maintaining working relationships with PR personnel, and interviewing public figures, where the feature would often sink or swim based on how effectively you could establish an immediate rapport with the interviewee.

#### Communication

Spending years in constant contact with editors, co-writers, researchers, PR and advertisers has honed my ability to get across exactly what's required at any given moment, not to mention my ability to give and receive feedback. This has been of great benefit while pair-programming.

#### Adaptability

At the Edinburgh Evening News I had to write features about pets, gardening and restaurants, despite at the time not owning a pet, not having a garden and not eating out often. At Sport.co.uk I was tasked with writing about sports with which I was relatively unfamiliar. Because of my ability to learn a lot in a short space of time, I always made it work. I can only envisage this serving me well as a junior developer!

#### Compliance with Tight Deadlines

I mean, this just came with the territory...

## Hobbies

I'm a keen musician and songwriter, a veteran of the Camden pub circuit. As well as that I've tried my hand at comedy, performing at the Edinburgh Fringe in 2018 and Glasgow Fringe in 2019. This latter hobby also led to a couple of bizarre TV appearances. I also love going out and running long distances, and the resultant hunger perfectly complements another passion of mine: cooking (my signature dish is a Moroccan-style tagine).
